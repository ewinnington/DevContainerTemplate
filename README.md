# Dev Container Template

My developer container with: 

- dotnet
- java (with Maven)
- python
- nodejs
- postgresql
- docker
- terraform
- azure cli

So that I can just use it as a base anywhere and it will work for most of my use cases. 

This repo also contains some automation scripts to repeatedly: 

- Run a bash Integration / Deployment with docker, terraform, azure-cli
- Initialize a docker postgresDB on host marchine
- Initialize a postgresDB inside the container
